# EmbodiedAI 2020
This repository contains the practical materials for the Embodied Artificial Intelligence course.

## Installation
To run this software, install the dependencies by running

    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt --user

## How it works
To run the code simply execute the main.py file. For more detailed overview of the code structure and functionality, please see the supplementary document 'CodeTutorial'.


## NOTE

There is a known bug that may crash the program in random occasions, regarding the memory usage of pygame.
When this bug appears, just waiting couple of seconds and re-running the program should
fix it

We are actively working for fixing this.
